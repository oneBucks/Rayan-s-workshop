            <p class="text-overlay left">Hey guys, today I want to tell you a story, a little story about myself. I just came home today, and you probably all know what happened today. I'm impressed by some things and at the same time disappointed. I have many thoughts on my mind now, and I'm not sure if I'll do a good job of sharing it in an appropriate way so everybody will understand what I mean. I want to say that I'm proud of all of you because what you did, nobody has ever done for me. I've lived in a world where there is no support, and I've had to fight for myself. Today, you changed that. I'm never going to forget what people did to me, and I swear you will receive it back because I always pay my bills. But I want to give you a lesson and remind you all about the chances we all have and how important they are. Mr. Curtis put us in a situation that pushed us to make a tough decision. Joshua, I love you, man. Thank you for doing that for me, and thank you to everybody who stood up for me. Here's a lesson: 'In a great storm, a strong oak tree may fall, but a reed will simply bend and then grow even stronger.' 'Water does not break the stone but flows around it.' So please, be that reed, be that water. We are going to be leaders; we can't ruin the chance we all have. Please be careful. I've been in very tough situations in my life; trust me, this was nothing to me. If I looked offended, it's because I wanted to calm down a situation and prevent any bad consequences.
            </p>
            <p class="text-overlay rigth">Mr. Curtis asked us to think about who we are; he gave us two minutes for this. I didn't need those two minutes because I already know who I am. I'm a tiger tamer. When my friend Joshua stood up for me and asked me this question, I answered him the same. He asked if there weren't any tigers that needed to be tamed. I didn't catch it at first because my English isn't great, but on my way home, I understood. There were no tigers; there was just a little old man, bro.</p>
