            <p><b>H</b>ey guys, today I want to tell you a story, a little story about myself. I just came home today,
                and you
                probably all know what happened today. I'm impressed by some things and at the same time disappointed. I
                have many thoughts on my mind now, and I'm not sure if I'll do a good job of sharing it in an
                appropriate
                way so everybody will understand what I mean. I want to say that I'm proud of all of you because what
                you
                did, nobody has ever done for me. I've lived in a world where there is no support, and I've had to fight
                for
                myself. Today, you changed that. I'm never going to forget what people did to me, and I swear you will
                receive it back because I always pay my bills. But I want to give you a lesson and remind you all about
                the
                chances we all have and how important they are. Mr. Curtis put us in a situation that pushed us to make
                a
                tough decision. Joshua, I love you, man. Thank you for doing that for me, and thank you to everybody who
                stood up for me.</p>

            <p><b>H</b>ere's a lesson: 'In a great storm, a strong oak tree may fall, but a reed will simply bend and
                then grow
                even stronger.' 'Water does not break the stone but flows around it.' So please, <b>be that reed, be
                    that
                    water</b>. We are going to be leaders; we can't ruin the chance we all have. Please be careful. I've
                been in
                very tough situations in my life; trust me, this was nothing to me. If I looked offended, it's because I
                wanted to calm down a situation and prevent any bad consequences.
                Mr. Curtis asked us to think about who we are; he gave us two minutes for this. I didn't need those two
                minutes because I already know who I am. I'm a <em>tiger tamer</em>. When my friend Joshua stood up for
                me and asked
                me this question, I answered him the same. He asked if there weren't any tigers that needed to be tamed.
                I
                didn't catch it at first because my English isn't great, but on my way home, I understood. There were no
                tigers; there was just a little old man, bro.</p>
